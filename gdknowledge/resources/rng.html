    <h1>RNG</h1>
    <p>This article contains info on how randomness works in this game.</p>
    <h2>The basics</h2>
    <p>There's 1 random seed per level that is generated randomly on each attempt (the seed stays the same when restarting from checkpoint).</p> 
    <p>GD's randomness uses the standard rand() function from C++. An accurate reimplementation of C++'s PRNG in Python can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaniloNC/89ff515689d5f6d7f2a585b098e2c03e">here.</a></p> 
    <p>4 triggers utilize this seed: Random, AdvRand, Advanced Follow and Edit AdvFollow.</p>
    <h2>Random trigger</h2>
    <p>This one is actually pretty simple to reverse engineer without even reverse engineering the game, as long as you have Mega Hack v8.</p>
    <p>It works as follows: if (rand() / 32767 * 100) is less than or equal to the chance value, activate group 1. Otherwise, activate group 2.</p>
    <h2>AdvRand trigger</h2>
    <p>This one, on the other hand, is more complicated.</p>
    <p>Here's an implementation in JavaScript (weights is an array of all chances for each group):</p>
    <pre><code>function advancedRandom(weights) {
        let value = rand() / 32767 * weights.reduce((a, b) => a + b)
        let num = 0
        for (let i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
            num += weights[i]
            if (num >= value)
                return i + 1;
        }
        return NaN
    }</code></pre>
    <h2>Advanced Follow trigger</h2>
    <p>TODO: ADD IMPLEMENTATION</p>
    <p>It calls rand() for every non-zero +- value</p>
    <h2>Edit AdvFollow trigger</h2>
    <p>TODO: ADD IMPLEMENTATION</p>
    <p>It calls rand() 3 times, and 1 extra time if Speed +- is not 0</p>

<p>In each of the layers, the objects that are rendered last take priority (and usually that matches up with their order in the level string)</p>
