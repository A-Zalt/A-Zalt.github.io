    <h1>The Geometry Dash Object Rabbit Hole</h1>
    <p>GD levels consist of objects. And internally, each of these objects have their own IDs. It might seem simple: the object IDs are incremental and their amount increases with each version. 
      While both of these statements are true, the Geometry Dash object ID rabbit hole goes so much deeper than that. This document intends to describe all of the oddities relating to
      Geometry Dash objects.</p>
    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <p>Let's start with the basics. Object IDs are incremental and they start with the default block with the ID of 1, and end all the way with the 2.2 floppy disc collectible with the ID of 4539.</p>
    <p>But obviously, not all of them were added right in 1.0. So let's see what was the last object ID in every version.</p>
        <table border="1">

    <p>Object IDs 37 and 44 DO exist, but they can't be placed in the level by themselves. ID 37 is the thing on top of the pulsing rod, and ID 44 is the practice mode checkpoint.</p>
    <p>Although, if you think there are 4539 different objects in the game, you are sorely mistaken. There's a lot of object IDs that are not in 2.2, and a lot of them have not been used in any version for unknown reasons. Here's a list of them and the version they would be added in:</p>

    <p>That makes for a grand total of 335 skipped object IDs, 65 of which are from 1.8, 92 from 2.0, 105 from 2.1, 65 from 2.2, and the remaining 10 are from earlier versions.</p>
    <h2>Miscellaneous Objects</h2>
    <p>This is where the rabbit hole begins. Out of all 4539 object IDs, there are 479 that have either been hidden at one point, or did not exist at one point after already being added in a previous version.</p>
    <p>479 is a lot of object IDs, but there are large groups of objects where their history follows the same template. I will go over them now to avoid redundancy when listing out the object IDs one by one.</p>
    <h3>Black Objects</h3>
    <p>There are some objects in GD that are black by default, which is done using the color ID 1010. However, in 2.1, RobTop decided to add the option of changing the color of black saws, ground spikes, slabs and fake spikes. However, adding this functionality to the old objects would cause some older levels to have broken colors, so he decided to create new objects and unlist the older ones. Below is yet another table that documents the object IDs affected by this.</p>

    <h3>Old slopes</h3>
    <p>Most slopes with outlines got unlisted in 2.1, although a few got listed as a new object. The only difference between the 2 objects I could find is the (visually) slightly longer outline. Here's a table of these slopes:</p>

    <p>The slopes with ID 349 and 351 got relisted in 2.2 (specifically, the SubZero 2022 leak), because of necessity for Nine Circles levels. They are 2 of the 3 objects that have ever been unlisted and then relisted again. The other object is covered later in this document.</p>
    <p>Here are the unlisted slopes: 321, 323, 331, 333, 337, 339, 343, 345, 349, 351, 353, 355, 483, 484, 492, 493, 651, 652, 709, 710, 711, 712, 726, 727, 728, 729, 886, 887</p>
    <h3>1.6 blocks with outlines</h3>
    <p>In 2.0, object IDs 160-169 and 193 were unlisted and their versions without outlines were listed instead (starts at 1140). However, object IDs 164 and 193 did not even have an outline, but were replaced anyway with what is an identical object, just with a different object ID. So when making a level backporter, one should replace ID 1142 and 1148 with 164 and 193 respectively.</p>
    <h3>Old color triggers</h3>
    <p>All the way from 1.0 up to 2.0, there were new color triggers added that in 2.1 were merged into the color trigger (which was added in 2.0). And in 2.2, their sprites got removed and changed to the Color trigger sprite. Final table of the document, I promise:</p>
