    <h1>Layering in old versions (pre-1.9?)</h1>
    <p>In GD 1.00, the following layers existed (from top to bottom):</p>

<strong>Portal</strong> - the right part of portals is on the highest layer and renders above all objects<br>
<strong>Ground spike</strong> - the ground spikes render above everything (except for the right part of portals)<br>
<strong>Default</strong> - this is the layer for most objects, such as blocks, pads, orbs and the left part of portals<br>
<strong>Blending</strong> - this is the layer for ground spike deco and chains<br>

<p>In each of the layers, the objects that are rendered last take priority (and usually that matches up with their order in the level string)</p>
<p>It's worth noting that this layering system had some changes. In 1.10, the decorative grid block became its own layer between Default and Blending (non-solid black objects from future versions go on this layer). In 1.40, the Ground Spike layer stopped existing and got merged into the Default layer.</p>
