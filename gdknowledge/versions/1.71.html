<h1>1.71</h1>
<h2>Changes from 1.70:</h2>
- Fixed a bug where changing your local level's name wouldn't update the upload button immediately and it would still think the older name is in effect<br>
- Fixed a bug where respawning from a checkpoint would put you in the cube gamemode, regardless of whether the level starts with the cube gamemode or not<br>
- Fixed a bug where you can die and complete the level at the same time when bounced into the ground by a pad while upside down<br>
- Pressing the equivalent of "Enter" on an on-screen keyboard now exits text input<br>
<h3>Not-in-game content</h3>
