<h1>1.40</h1>
<h2>Changes from 1.30:</h2>
- Added new main level & song: Clutterfunk<br>
- Added 4 new ships (Clutterfunk!; Demonic Guardian; Epic Collector; Epic Master Collector)<br>
- Added new magenta player color<br>
- Changed appearance of default ship<br>
- Added mini & normal size portal<br>
- Added saws and their respective decorative objects<br>
- Added black tileset<br>
- Changed the appearance of the unlisted tileset from 1.3 and it's no longer unlisted, but the corner block was removed<br>
- Added small spike<br>
- Added Line color trigger<br>
- Added Magic tab to Search<br>
- Ball clicks are no longer buffered after orbs<br>
- Added ball snapping bug<br>
- The New button in the level editor selection menu is now on the bottom<br>
- Your custom levels are now paginated and have a counter on the top right. This is due to MyLevelsLayer being replaced with LevelBrowserLayer<br>
- Your custom levels are also sorted differently<br>
- Object ID 83 now has glow, which was missing before<br>
- The Edit Object button from the Edit Tab was moved to the right side of the editor. It only appears when a color trigger is selected<br>
- Added Facebook link for DJVI in the Download Soundtracks menu<br>
- Links for the soundtracks in the Download Soundtracks menu now go to YouTube instead of Newgrounds<br>
- The ground was very slightly tweaked. It is now a pixel higher and the ground line is no longer tinted by the ground color<br>
- The Facebook button on the main menu now checks for your Internet connection<br>
- Portals (and other large objects) now only take up 1 grid space, allowing you to place them closer to each other<br>
- Ground spikes now render on the same layer as most other objects. This can be seen in the level Dry Out, where some ground spikes appear below regular spikes, which doesn't happen in 1.3<br>
- Fixed a bug where pressing the back button twice from a level you opened in the Featured tab would take you to the Search tab<br>
- Fixed a bug where pressing the back button on a saved level that has an empty level string would take you back to search results (this crashed the game if you hadn't searched anything this session)<br>
<h3>Not-in-game content</h3>
- Added unlisted Object color trigger<br>
- Manifest version changed from 10 to 11<br>
- Game version changed from 4 to 5<br>
- Save file binaryVersion changed from 4 to 5<br>
- Removed unused 1.3 ship designs from spritesheet<br>
- Added unlisted official level "Active". It had no level data other than song guidelines<br>
- Added RobTop-only Set Featured menu<br>
- Fixed down arrow in RobTop-only Set Stars menu. In 1.3, it worked like the up arrow<br>
