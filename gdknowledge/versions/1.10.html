- The "More by this user" button in the level info menu has been moved next to the username and shortened to "More" due to the addition of comments<br>
- Pause button now has an outline<br>
- The "Level download failed" popup can no longer appear before the LevelInfoLayer of the level has been fully loaded<br>
- Non-solid black objects (this includes only the decorative grid block in this version) are now layered below most other objects, with the exception of ground spike deco and chains<br>
- Your saved levels are now sorted top to bottom from most recently downloaded to least, as opposed to being sorted the other way around<br>

- Game version changed from 1 to 2<br>
- Your own levels are now stored in CCLocalLevels.dat<br>
- The endpoint likeGJItem.php is now used for liking/disliking levels instead of likeGJLevel.php<br>
