<h1>1.02</h1>
libgame.so file date: September 1st 2013, 12:29 (GMT+2)<br>
<h2>Changes from 1.01:</h2>
- Background and Ground color selection menus no longer crash, since the game now loads the color wheel textures from the correct place (assets instead of assets/extensions)<br>
- You can no longer verify levels in practice mode<br>
- The "you can't share a level until you've completed it" message now has the word "completed" colored green and white "any mode" was replaced with blue "normal mode"<br>
- Portals now only activate once<br>
- Search bar now has additional highlight for the text field<br>
- Editor objects now start 10 grid spaces away from player<br>
- You can now move objects to the left of the starting area<br>
- Background and ground no longer reset to their starting position on death<br>
- Fixed portal particles when transition triggers are used<br>
- Starting position of background and ground was changed<br>
- The dots at the bottom of the main level selection screen now switch immediately upon changing the page<br>
- "Jump rings are more responsive" - RobTop. Might be related: you can now activate them while not in the air<br>
- Boomlings can now be seen in the More Games tab again due to the More Games string being changed to boom_mu_mm, just like it was in 1.00<br>
- When you restart right as you complete the level, it doesn't get instantly completed a second time, although the first completion still happens<br>
- Editor height limit increased from 30 grid spaces to 40<br>
- Your save data is now automatically written to the save file when you Save and Exit from a level in the editor<br>
- Fixed a bug where after renaming a local level, it wouldn't immediately update on the My Levels screen<br>
- Portal/pad/orb particles near the start are now somewhat visible<br>
- Pad particles have been moved slightly higher so that they no longer spawn under the pad<br>
- Your level percentages are now shown on the level browser menu<br>
- After going through a ship portal and back into a cube portal (or doing the same with orange/blue mirror portals), orbs no longer emit pulse<br>
- Transition triggers now apply to practice mode checkpoints<br>
<h3>Not-in-game content</h3>
- Manifest version changed from 3 to 4<br>
- Removed "portal03_front_001.png" from GJ_GameSheet, which is just a copy of "portal_03_front_001.png" and seemingly served no purpose.<br>
- Added unlisted mirror portals<br>
- Added an unlisted beta version of Time Machine<br>
- Added some unlisted functionality related to dislikes<br>
- Added some unlisted functionality related to comments<br>
- Fixed a bug where the color wheel would select darker colors than it should. However, you could not observe this in 1.00-1.01 without modifying the game, as trying to access the color wheel would crash the game<br>
